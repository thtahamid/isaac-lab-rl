The Problem
Isaac Sim's bundled PyTorch libraries (libcusparse.so.12) are looking for CUDA 12.8 symbols, but your system has CUDA 13.0. The symbol __nvJitLinkCreate_12_8 doesn't exist in CUDA 13.0.

Solutions to Try
Option 1: Use Isaac Sim's bundled CUDA libraries (Recommended)


unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH && ./isaac-sim.sh
Perfect! Isaac Sim is now running successfully! 🎉

What Fixed It
The solution was to clear the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable by running:


unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH && ./isaac-sim.sh
Why This Worked
Your system CUDA 13.0 libraries were conflicting with Isaac Sim's bundled CUDA 12.x libraries
By unsetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH, Isaac Sim now uses its own bundled libraries instead of trying to mix system CUDA 13.0 with its internal PyTorch CUDA 12.8 dependencies
Isaac Sim ships with all the CUDA libraries it needs - it doesn't require system CUDA to be in the library path
Current Status
Isaac Sim is now running with:

✅ All extensions loaded successfully
✅ ROS2 bridge loaded (using internal rclpy for Humble distro)
✅ App is ready at 18 seconds
⚠️ Only deprecation warnings (these are normal and non-critical)
The app should now be fully functional! If you need to run it again in the future, just use:


unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH && ./isaac-sim.sh
Or add this to the beginning of the isaac-sim.sh script to make it permanent.
